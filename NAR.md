### A template email for NAR due to their silly preprint citation policy

Hi Drs. Babu, Fox, and Stoddard,

Thank you for the invitation to review. I have great respect for the quality of papers published in the journal, and I have published my own papers there in the past. However, I must decline this review request due to your journal's policy against citing preprints.

Your journal policy is that articles in your journal may not cite preprints of manuscripts. There appears to be no valid reason for this policy, which appears to be unique among journals, and it hampers the practice of scientific communication. Citation is a way of identifying the origin of an idea or method. If we cannot cite a preprint, the chain of credit is broken. This break in the chain diminishes the value of any work published in your journal.

In any case, thank you for the invitation. Because this policy harms the practice of science, I will not submit any of our lab's work to you and will continue to decline review requests from your journal until it is revised. This is too bad, because the NAR webserver issue has generally been one that I have viewed favorably.

Sincerely,
Casey
